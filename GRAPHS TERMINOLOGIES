// Connected Graph: Each node has path from every other node. 
// Disconnected Graph: Each node does not have path from every other node.

// Each connected graph in a disconnected graph is called connected component.
//    1-2  3   4-5     ,here in this graph 1,2 are connected component and 4,5 are connected components


// Cycles in a graph: Path from a vertex to the same vertex in a graph is known as cycle. 
// Cyclic Graph: Graph that contains cycle is called cyclic graph. 
// Acyclic Graph: Graph that does not contain cycle is called acyclic graph.


///Tree: Its connected acyclic graph.
// Properties of a Tree with n nodes:
//  1. No of edges=n-1
//  2. There are no cycles present.
//  3. Each node has path from every other vertex.

// Directed Acyclic Graph(DAG) 
// As the name suggests,its properties are:
// 1. It has directed edges.
// 2. It is acyclic ie no cycles are present.

// Complete Graph: 
// A graph in which each vertex is connected to every other vertex by a direct edge.
